# WGSS 10 Blog Client

In this lab, I built a CRUD blog platform using React, Redux, and React-Router. I used Axios API calls to allow my frontend to communicate with the server. I also made use of an action, reducer, component structure in order to build this blog platform which allows users to view, create, edit, and delete blog posts.
