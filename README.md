# SA3: Frontend Starterpack

In this short assignment, I set up my starterpack and deployed my first webpage via webpack.
The starterpack includes Webpack, Babel, ESLint, SASS among other things. It will be used in other assignments and updated throughout the course.

## What Worked Well
- The instructions were very clear and it was easy enough to follow along. 
- It is cool to see the webpack recompile automatically whenever a change is made in the CSS.

## What Didn't
- I originally wrote my index.js in normal JavaScript so I had to go back after already deploying my website and change it to jQuery.
